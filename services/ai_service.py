As an expert software project manager, analyze the following project and create a detailed Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) breakdown:

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Project Name: {project_data['name']}
- Description: {project_data['description']}
- Total Duration: {project_data['duration_weeks']} weeks
- Team Size: {project_data['team_size']}
- Project Type: {project_data['project_type']}
- Methodology: {project_data['methodology']}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Break down the project into appropriate SDLC phases based on the methodology
2. Allocate time (in weeks and percentages) for each phase
3. Ensure the total time equals exactly {project_data['duration_weeks']} weeks
4. Consider the project complexity, team size, and project type
5. Provide realistic time distributions based on industry best practices

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):

        "total_duration_weeks": {project_data['duration_weeks']},

        "complexity_assessment": "High/Medium/Low based on description"

    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Key recommendation 1",
        "Key recommendation 2"
    ]
}}

GUIDELINES:
- For Agile: Include Sprint Planning, Development Sprints, Testing, Deployment phases
- For Waterfall: Include Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
- For Hybrid: Combine elements appropriately
- Consider project type complexity (Web apps need more frontend work, APIs need more backend focus)
- Adjust phase durations based on team size (larger teams may need more coordination time)
- Include buffer time for complex projects
- Make recommendations specific to the project context

Please provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text or formatting.
